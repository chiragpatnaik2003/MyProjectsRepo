# wheelRush
Wheel Rush is an exciting endless runner game built in Unity where players control a rolling wheel navigating through an obstacle-filled road. The player can move the wheel left and right using the arrow keys and jump to avoid obstacles. The road is dynamically generated with continuous road tiles, creating an endless track that challenges players to survive as long as possible.

As the wheel moves forward, it encounters various obstacles such as cones, which the player must dodge to keep going. If the wheel collides with an obstacle, the game ends, and a Game Over screen is displayed. Along the way, the player can also collect coins scattered on the track to increase their score. The game progressively becomes more challenging as the speed increases over time, requiring quick reflexes and precise movements to keep going.

Built using Unity and C#, Wheel Rush implements core game development techniques such as object pooling for efficient tile spawning, physics-based movement for realistic interactions, and procedural generation for an unpredictable and engaging gameplay experience.
