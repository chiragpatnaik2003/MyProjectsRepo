# wheelRush
Wheel Rush is an exciting endless runner game built in Unity where players control a rolling wheel navigating through an obstacle-filled road. The game challenges players to dodge obstacles, collect coins, and survive as long as possible while the speed progressively increases.

Gameplay Features:
🎮 Simple Controls: Move the wheel left & right using arrow keys and jump to avoid obstacles.
🛣️ Endless Road Tiles: The track is dynamically generated with procedurally spawned road tiles.
🚧 Obstacles & Challenges: Watch out for cones and other obstacles—hitting them results in Game Over.
💰 Coin Collection: Collect coins along the way to increase your score.
⚡ Increasing Difficulty: The game gets harder over time as the speed increases.
🔹 Built with Unity Engine & C#, this game demonstrates object pooling, procedural generation, and physics-based movement.
